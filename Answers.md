1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
    Semantic HTML can be considered the foundation and structural components of a website. Semantic HTML has a set of tags used to set the structure and indicate it's meaning at the same time. i.e. a `<nav>` tag indicates an element where navigation is held.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
    `display: block` takes up the full width of the screen and will not wrap with other blocks. Block level elements respect width and height properties. Display is set to block by default.
    `display: inline-block` will only take up as much width as the content inside and wrap with other inline-blocks nearby. Inline-block respects height property.
3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
    content, padding, border, margin

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?
`align-items: center` centers the content vertically along the cross axis.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 
    `git commit -m "message goes here"`
